In this folder you will find several projects , some performed while attending General Assembly (GA), Data Science immersive Course
and other more personals

As per limitation of times, the projects made at GA only focused at some aspects and might not be complete.
_I invite anyone who would like to carry on and go deeper to use my starter code on my github account_
